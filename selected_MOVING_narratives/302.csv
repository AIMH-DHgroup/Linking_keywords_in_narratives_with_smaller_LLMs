"PGI (Protected Geographical Indication) Goat cheese / Undredal Brown Cheese","The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SKANDINAVIAN UCO. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 09 SCA. The cheese is made from April to October and has always been made with milk from the local goats. There are three families belonging to the Undredal Stølsysteri SA. Although they do not pasteurize the milk, they have full authorization for production and sale throughout Europe. Since 2005, the Slowfood Foundation for Biodiversity established here the first Norwegian Presidium for the Brimost cheese. The Presidium (Undredal Brown Cheese Presidium) includes 6 cheese makers of the cooperative plus two shopkeepers of the town that sell the local cheese. They sell the cheese online, in the Undredal's local store, in the annual cheese market in Undredal and in other regions' markets. The VC has great influence in the SES, since the activity is of great importance for the maintenance of natural pastures while the end product is a key asset for the village, attracting many visitors and energising the local enconomy.","norway, europe, cheese, april, october, milk, undredal, authorization, biodiversity, presidium, cooperative, town","https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q20, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q46, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q10943, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q118, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q124, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q8495, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1006480, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q788590, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q47041, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2115302, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q4539, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3957",7.102777777,60.949444444,14.76093611111111,64.77964194444445

"Key local assets","Tha natural assets are the natural pastures and the forage for the winter months. The goats graze in pastures from April till the end of the warm season. In Undfredal (town within the municipality of Aureland), goats and the cheese are both considered as cultural assets and they are part of the territorial identity of the inhabitants. It was not untill 1986 that they had road comunication with other urban settlements, so they used to be completelly dependent on their local dairy production. They celebrate an annual cheese market that hosts many visitors. Besides, this VC is part of Norsk Gardsost, an association of traditional dairies in Norway, as well as being endorsed by a Slowfood Presidium where various actors of the locality are involved.
