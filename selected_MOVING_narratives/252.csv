"Sporting game - organised hunting of deer in Perth and Kinross LAU1","The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SCOTLAND HUTTON. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 04 UK. Deer hunting (stalking) are popular tourist activities within the Highlands and Islands of Scotland. The land is which the stalking takes place is wild land, however it is managed in terms of the culling of mountain hares and burning of heather/ gorse to improve hunting potential in the area. Stalking season for stags runs between July and October, but roe and fallow bucks can be stalked almost year round. Within Perth and Kinross (LAU1) there are a range of estates and gamekeepers offering opportunities for stalking including Blair Atholl Estates and Glen Lyon. Venison meat is then sold across Perth and Kinross and the wider Highlands and islands NUT3 region in local butchers and online hubs e.g. www.highlandgame.com.","scotland, deer, hunting, mountain, potential, july, october, roe, year, blair atholl, venison, meat, perth","http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q22, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q23390, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q36963, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q8502, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1202245, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q121, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q124, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q219426, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q577, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q881156, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2296872, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q10990, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3183",-5.0,57.0,-5.0,57.0
"Mountain landscape and reference chains","The reference mountain chain of this VC is Highlands and Islands (RR9); Eastern Scotland (NUTS2). The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Perth and Kinross.

The south contains high quality agricultural land and major road and rail links, and the largest settlement of Perth. Like many other parts of the Highlands, this region is popular for tourism and outdoor recreation: it is a relatively accessible area for residents of Scotland's central belt.","scotland, mountain, landscape, perth, central belt","http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q22, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q8502, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q107425, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3183, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1053720",-5.0,57.0,-5.0,57.0

"Interest on this VC","Sporting game is an important income for many Scottish estates and many have high reputations around the world. Deer stalking alone is a Â£100 million industry. All stalking is undertaken with a stalking guide to ensure overstalking does not occur.The land is wild but is managed in terms of burning gorse/heather and culling mountains hares as they interfere with the game hunting. Vension meat is of high quality and reputation within and beyond Scotland. For instance, the industry has its own safegaurd (Scottish Quality Wild Vensions) to ensure high standards of meat procurement and handling. Within Perth and Kinross Atholl estate (www.atholl-estates.co.uk) undertake 3-yearly cycle of surveys aiming for measurable improvement in habitat quality. They use drones/ thermal imaging/ camera traps to count dear numbers. To ensure 'good' hunting practices, Blair Atholl and Glen Lyon estate use innovative methods for counting deer numbers to ensure that population numbers maintain healthy numbers. Use of a range of innvoative counting mechanisms. Such mechanisms can also be used to explore the level of conflict between deer and hikers, sheep numbers, other bird poulation numbers.","scotland, blair atholl, game, hunting, meat, atholl, deer","http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q22, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q881156, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q11410, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q36963, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q10990, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q331254, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q23390",-3.794,56.704,-5.0,57.0
"Key local assets","Natural assets: relies on wild (but managed) land to ensure there is a hospitable environment for the deer and grouse. Also, this land contributes to nice and attractive scenery for stalking visitors. Social assets: relies on good relations with the local communities living and working near and in these stalking estates (i.e., for tourist accomodation), with hikers and wildlfie conservation organsiations. In terms of cultural assets, sporting game relies on traditional and local knowledge for stalking practices, processes and habitat management. The processes for deer stalking have remained largely the same for centuries, including the use of ponies to remove deer trophies from the moutain.

Challenges,"potential for or existing conflicts with other agricultural activities (i.e., sheep) and hillwalking. Relies heavily on international tourists which have been absent during COVID. Potential conflicts over land management practices and culling of mountain hares and burning of gorse. Conflicts between organisations promoting the culling of deer and those visiting for stalking purposes (i.e., returning empty-handed). For grouse shooting there are also actual/ potential conflicts with population numbers of other birds (i.e., raptors) being scared off/ accidentally killed. Potential difficulties in sale of venison eat abroad due to brexit. Risk of overgrazing of landscape. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.","hillwalking, management, mountain, deer, venison, brexit, overgrazing","http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1762646, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2920921, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q8502, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q23390, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2296872, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q7888194, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q334487",-3.8236190097072567,56.56674045279443,-5.0,57.0
Innovation,"The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. methods of counting deer numbers -i.e. using drones, camera traps, GPS collars, thermal imaging. The innovation is related to New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Natural land. The local assets include Natural, Social and Cultural.","innovation, governance","http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q174165, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1553864",-3.8236190097072567,56.56674045279443,-5.0,57.0
"Concluding remarks","Deer stalking is run from multiple sites across the Highland and Islands NUT3 region of Scotland (e.g. Aberdeenshire, Badendoch and Strathsphey LAU1 areas especially- mostly on the mainland. Grouse shooting is another VC also undertaken in this region but also North east and North West England (NUTS3 regions).","highland, scotland, north west england, aberdeenshire","http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q878223, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q22, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q47967, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q189912",-5.0,57.0,-5.0,57.0
