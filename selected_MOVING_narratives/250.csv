"Mountain landscape and reference chains","The reference mountain chain of this VC is West Wales (NUTS 2). The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Caerphilly. Caerphilly is in the south of Wales and is a densely populated area of steep-sided valleys, situated close to Cardiff and Newport. Historically it is an industrial and mining region, and although the area has lost its traditional industries, the secondary sector remains a key part of the economy. The area is not a traditional tourist destination (in the way that other parts of Wales are) and has suffered from periods of high unemployment in the past.","west wales, wales, mountain, landscape, caerphilly","http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3094812, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q25, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q8502, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q107425, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q909119",-3.633333333,52.35,-5.0,57.0

"Interest on this VC","Caerphilly cheese was first made in Caerphilly in 1830.Caerphilly cheese is mass produced in English counties of Somerset and Wiltshire, however Castle Dairies began to make the cheese once again in Caerphilly using pre-war production techniques (i.e., by hand). Caerphilly town hosts an annual three-day festival to celebrate the cheese (The Big Cheese). This attracts 80,000 visitors annually. Variants of Caerphilly cheese (i.e., Gorwydd) have won gold awards at the International Cheese Awards. Important for territorial identity (festival, culture in Caerphilly itself). New (in the form of old and traditional pre-war) processes are made to create local Caerphilly cheese. There is also a greater link and ties made to the area of Caerphilly (i.e., with the festival and PGI).","somerset, international cheese awards, caerphilly, cheese, wiltshire, castle, war, town, day, festival","http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q23157, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q6049165, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q909119, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q10943, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q23183, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q23413, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q198, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3957, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q573, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q132241",-3.218,51.578,-5.0,57.0
"Key local assets","Relies on/ creates natural, social and cultural local assets. In terms of natural assets Caerphilly cheese relies on land that is suitable for dairy cattle. There are also connections to natural scenery assets as a base for the tourism from the annual Big Cheese festival. In terms of social assets, the Big Cheese fetival relies on strong community relations within caerphilly. For cultural assests, there is a reliance on local and traditional knowledge for undertaking tradional (but innovative) processing of Caerphilly cheese. There is also a lot of cultural heritage tied into the brand, even from those made in England. There are links to the cultural history of Caerphilyl as the cheese was orignally made for local coal minres. PGI status also for Welsh spelling of the term linking again to cultural assets.

Challenges,"Relies partly on tourism to areas, so difficult during COVID. Lots of the cheese is now made in England so threat to territorial identity if the local Caerphilly producers cannot compete/ continue. Pre-war techniques of local Cerphilly producers more expensive that mass production methods. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.","england, cheese, threat, caerphilly, war","http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q21, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q10943, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q707125, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q909119, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q198",-1.0,53.0,-5.0,57.0
Innovation,"The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. Most non-local Caerphilly cheese is made using factory and machine-based methods. However, the innovative aspect of locally-based Caerphilly cheese is actually the re-engagement with traditional pre-war cheesemaking processes in which the cheese is made by hand. It is also innovative in its return to making the cheese within the town and surronding area of Caerphilly. The innovation is related to New processes and New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are Grassland. The local assets include Natural, Social and Cultural.","innovation, factory, machine, caerphilly, cheese, engagement, war, cheesemaking, town, marketing, grassland","http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q174165, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q83405, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q11019, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q909119, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q10943, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q157512, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q198, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1281188, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3957, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q39809, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1006733",-3.218,51.578,-5.0,57.0
