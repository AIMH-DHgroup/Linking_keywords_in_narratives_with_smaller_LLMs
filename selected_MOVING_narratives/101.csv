The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 10 GR. The cultivation and the exploitation of the chestnut trees is a family and a community business for the majority of the farmers. The chestnut collection is an event that is celebrated. The perspectives of the product bring together the farmers, the local government, the academic institutions, the local catering and tourism, and small firms of standardization, packaging, promotion and marketing.",greece,http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q41,23.0,38.5,23.0,38.5
"Mountain landscape and reference chains","The reference mountain chain of this VC is White Mountains. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is KISSAMOS. he White Mountains (2.453 m), the largest massif on the island, host a great variety of flora and fauna species, exclusively endemic (stenoendemic), not to be found anywhere else not even in other parts of Crete. The areas on the southern side of the mountain range are covered with cypress, oak and pine trees, whereas humid areas favour the development of chestnuts, planes and other aquatic plants. The area of the chestnut trees is the western most part of the White Mountains. Elos (LAU2 Code: 74050201) is the center of the VC. The VC is deployed in more than 20 little villages in the wider area, surrounded by forested and semi-forested land. The area is relatively close to coasts and tourist activities and in an hour distance from Chania international airport and Souda bay international harbor.","crete, mountain, landscape, kissamos, chania international airport, souda bay","http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q34374, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q8502, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q107425, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1021629, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1232348, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2633779",24.893333333,35.309722222,23.0,38.5

"Interest on this VC","Chestnut trees thrive in the western mountain areas of Crete, from 500m to 800m. Originally self-sown, nowadays also planted and cultivated, the Chania chestnut trees produce high quality chestnuts. The chestnut cultivation/ exploitation is traditional in the area. The local farmers, either through two cooperatives or individually sell their chestnuts to a local development company and to two private local firms, which process and promote the produce to the Cretan and the Greek market. There is also a limited interest from the Italian market. The chestnut tree performs various functions: productive, naturalistic, landscape, recreational. High quality product, high reputation product, territorial identity, cultural identity. The revived cultivation / exploitation of chestnut trees can become a sustainable activity for the mountainous areas of Crete and a serious alternative to the deadlocks of the olive oil monoculture.","crete, chania, tree, olive oil, monoculture","http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q34374, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q182299, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q10884, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q93165, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q220212",24.893333333,35.309722222,23.0,38.5
"Key local assets","The use of the forested / semi forested areas as well as the grasslands of Western White Mountains contribute to the improvement of the landscape and enhance the scenery, helping the local agro-tourism throughout the year. The chestnut activities enforce the social bonds and have a positive impact on the conservation of the local population and their activities. There is a traditional knowledge for the cultivation and preservation of the chestnut forests in the area. An annual 3-days chestnut festival is organized by the cultural associations of the area, which brings many visitors to the area.

Challenges,"20 years ago, the chestnut trees of the area faced a difficult period of infections and reduced production, which made many traditional farmers to move away from the chestnut exploitation. Due to the economic crisis, more and more farmers reconsidered the chestnut and have started planting and cultivating new trees. Nonetheless, the chestnut cultivation /exploitation remains partial activity for the local farmers, which result to lack of professionalism and specialization. The infections and the climate change increase the uncertainty, but, compared to competitive agricultural activities (e.g. olive oil trees), the chestnut has better perspectives in the Greek and international market. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.","crisis, olive oil","http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q381072, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q93165",23.625859265993725,35.42608126939979,23.0,38.5
Innovation,"The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Exogenous. Recently there is an increasing interest in the processing of the chestnuts and the production of processed products and by-products, mainly for the international market. The interest is mainly motivated by the Region of Crete and the academic institutions. The innovation is related to New products and New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are Grassland and Forestry. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.","crete, innovation, interest, marketing, grassland","http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q34374, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q174165, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q170924, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q39809, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1006733",24.893333333,35.309722222,23.0,38.5
"Concluding remarks","The cultivation of chestnut trees can be extended to the mountainous areas all over Crete. Similar VCs exist in other areas of Greece (EL531, EL525, EL612, EL644).","crete, greece","http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q34374, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q41",24.893333333,35.309722222,23.0,38.5
