"Interest on this VC","14 different types of cheese from cow, sheep and goat made of only local hey milk is matured in a former silver mine 100m deep in the mountain. It was initiated by an enthusiastic cheese lover, who turned his passion into a job, bought the 'pit house' in 2009 and had a 270 m tunnel built into the mountain and converted the 'pit house' into a 'cheese workshop'. The cheese is produced by the local Almenland dairy. Moreover it is well embedded in regional activities, and sold under the Almenland umbrella quality brand. It contributes to the touristic programme by means of guided tours and educational programmes, where visitors learn about the cheese, the maturation process, the history of the company and the Almenland region. Cheese tastings are offered as well.","cheese, sheep, goat, milk, silver, mountain, job, tunnel, house, workshop, dairy, umbrella, history","http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q10943, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q7368, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2934, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q8495, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1090, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q8502, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q192581, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q44377, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3947, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q656720, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q637776, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q41607, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q309",15.648804607839635,47.20873958185875,14.0,48.0
"Key local assets","The initiative perfectly fits into the Almenland 'Genussregion ( region of culinary delight : promoting local food specialities; quality standards set by the AgrarMarkt Austria); it adds value to the milk producing sector in the area; cooperation with the tourist sector is of mutual benefit; cooperation with other local Almenland producers: the company's online marketing platform does not only sell the cheese, but various (nearly all) other Almenland products.

Challenges,"As the cheese production relies exclusively on milk from the Almenland, challenges in milk production also affect this initiative. Predicted changes in climate (extreme weather conditions: drought, heavy rain) are likely to have effects on the feedbase for this pasture based meat production as the vegetation might change, and the cultivation of feed for the winter time might change as well. An increasing wastage of alpine pasture areas might demand in future for adjusting the pasture intensity and to significantly improve the quality of the forage plant growth. Another challenge refers to upscaling: the quantity of production is limited, while at the same time the demand is increasing also internationally. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.","cheese, milk, climate, weather, drought, rain, pasture, meat, vegetation, winter, demand, plant","http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q10943, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q8495, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q7937, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q11663, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q43059, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q7925, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q30121, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q10990, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q187997, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1311, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q4402708, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q756",15.648804607839635,47.20873958185875,14.0,48.0
Innovation,"The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. Specific processing: the cheese is matured in the tunnel of the former silver mine. Some types for a quite long time (1.5 years); the cheese is only mad from local hey milk, and many different types of cheese are produced. Participation in international cheese competitions: several awards have been achieved: e.g. the 'Arzberger Ursteirer' was even vice world champion in the USA. The innovation is related to New products, New processes and New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are pasture farming. The local assets include Natural.","innovation, cheese, milk, marketing","http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q174165, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q10943, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q8495, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q39809",15.648804607839635,47.20873958185875,14.0,48.0
"Concluding remarks","Cheese is produced in many other regions in the Austrian Alps; some of them are also made from hay milk; the maturing in a former silver mine is unique.","alps, cheese, hay, milk, silver","http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1286, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q10943, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q336989, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q8495, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1090",10.0,46.0,14.0,48.0
