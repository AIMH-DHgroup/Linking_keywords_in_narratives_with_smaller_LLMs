This folder contains 30 CSV files, each documenting textual descriptions of events for individual value chains. These files were generated by pre-processing the MS Excel sheet provided by the MOVING (MOuntain Valorisation through INterconnectedness and Green growth) European project and by enriching them with Wikidata entities and geographic coordinates. ( Bartalesi, V., Coro, G., Lenzi, E. et al. A Semantic Knowledge Graph of European Mountain Value Chains. Sci Data 11, 978 (2024). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-024-03760-9)
Each CSV file represents the narrative of a specific value chain, and each row represents a narrative event.

Each CSV file includes:

- 11 rows. 

- 2 columns (the title of the event and the textual description)
