"Interest on this VC","12 herb farmers from the Almenland Nature Park founded an association in order to jointly process and sell various products made from herbs under The 'Almenland Kr√§uter' brand. The herbs are grown in small-scale organic cultivation or collected in the wild nature. All are harvested by hand. They offer a large variety of different herbs and a wide range of products ranging from food and drinks to cosmetic and wellness products. First, the cooperation of the farmers by setting up an association is an interesting business model, secondly the product range is innovative. Finally they are well embedded in the regional development, and cooperate with the nature park, the local gastronomy and hotels, which promote their products, use and sell them. They offer educational/touristic programmes.","herb, nature, park, food, cooperation, business, gastronomy","http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q207123, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q7860, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q22698, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2095, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q380962, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q4830453, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q171141",15.648804607839635,47.20873958185875,14.0,48.0
"Key local assets","The initiative is well embedded in the regional development strategy of Almenland 'Genussregion ( region of culinary delight : promoting local food specialities; quality standards set by the AgrarMarkt Austria). Some of the educational programmes are carried out in cooperation with the nature park and imply activities raising awareness for the natural habitat in the area and health related aspects; activities also enrich the touristic programme. Moreover, from an ecological perspective, the cultivation of herbs helps improve the quality of near-natural areas by enabling more diverse agricultural production with less use of pesticides. Flowering plants in particular provide insects with nectar and pollen at different times of the year and thus have the potential to reduce habitat fragmentation. Preserving areas suitable for wild collection and carefully collecting herbs is a suitable way of preserving the diversity of permanent grasslands without changing the type of land use. On the one hand, this represents an increased food supply for insects and, on the other hand, it offers additional income for the local farmers.

Challenges,"Extreme weather conditions as a result of climate change do not only change the natural vegetation, but also cultivation practices. While some of the herbs are quite robust against climate change, others will need more complex treatment (e.g. irrigation), or will need to be replaced by other varieties. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.","climate, irrigation","http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q7937, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q11453",15.648804607839635,47.20873958185875,14.0,48.0
Innovation,"The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. The VC is particularly innovative in terms of products: they offer beside traditional food products made from herbs (e.g. tea, herbal salt, pure herbs), they created different spice mixes, liquor, syrups, and sweets with birch sugar. Moreover, they produce soaps and creams as well as incense materials. The innovation is related to New products, New processes and New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are Natural land. The local assets include Natural and cultural.","innovation, food, marketing","http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q174165, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2095, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q39809",15.648804607839635,47.20873958185875,14.0,48.0
