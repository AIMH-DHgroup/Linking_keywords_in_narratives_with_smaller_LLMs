Barley flour and groats,"The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SKANDINAVIAN UCO. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 07 SCA. Barley is the cereal that needs a shorter time to grow, which makes it suitable for mountain areas with extreme climate conditions like Roros. Nontheless, it takes 4 months for the barley to ripe in this place. Additionally, cold climate lowers the exposure to diseases like fungui, so they do not need to spray any pesticide in the fields (only three times in ten years). They are part of the Rorosmat, a regional brand to certify products from the area.","cereal, mountain, climate, pesticide, norway","http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q12117, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q8502, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q7937, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q131656, https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q20",10.538986154828823,62.400549498728566,14.76093611111111,64.77964194444445
