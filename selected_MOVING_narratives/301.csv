"Pultost cow cheese","The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SKANDINAVIAN UCO. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 08 SCA. Pultost is a sour milk cheese made from cow's milk without the use of rennet. Instead, a self-produced culture of old strains of lactic bacteria is added to start the coagulation. Once the cheese is drained, crumbled and fermented, salt and caraway seeds are added to stop fermentation, giving to it a special character. The cheese can be eaten fresh or matured in wooden containers up to one year. The leftover cream is used to produce sour cream or butter. This cheese is endorsed by the Slowfood Foundation for Biodiversity.","pultost, milk, rennet, self, bacteria, cheese, fermentation, year, cream, sour cream, butter, biodiversity, norway","http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1776589, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q8495, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q326900, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3236990, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q10876, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q10943, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q41760, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q577, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q13228, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q840171, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q34172, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q47041, https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q20",8.635888866011713,62.191373020128005,14.76093611111111,64.77964194444445
"Mountain landscape and reference chains","The reference mountain chain of this VC is Scandinavean Mountains - Scandes. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Lesja. Lesja is a high mountainous area with an important water body in altitude, the Lesjaskogsvatnet (Lesjas lake). It has two outflows draining the west to the Rauma river and the east to the Gudbrandsdalsl√•gen river. Besides the Lesjas lake, there are more than 400 lakes within the municipality and most of them are above the treeline and they are habitat of the Norwegian trout. Most of the municipality is above 900 masl, and many traditional summer farms are located along the treeline. These farms are very important for extensive traditional livestock systems during the summer months when animals graze in high altitude pastures.","lesja, water, altitude, lesjaskogsvatnet, lake, municipality, trout","http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q488405, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q283, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q190200, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1820743, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q23397, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q15284, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2258881",8.644722222,62.210555555,14.76093611111111,64.77964194444445
