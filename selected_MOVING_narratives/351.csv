"Elderly care in Carcabuey","The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is SPAIN ADEGUA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 34 ES. This highly feminised value chain combines public, private and social resources in a mixed governance system that incorporates the monetised and the non-monetised, and which is allowing both these elderly people and local and immigrant women who work in the chain to stay in the territory and for the first time professionalise the sector, while generating tangible and intangible, individual and collective value. It is a self-perceived quality chain in which the cultural, participatory and social cohesion aspects of the municipality are of great relevance, together with the health, care or family aspects that are generally present in the care field.","spain, value chain","http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q29, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q646107",-3.5,40.2,-3.5,40.2
"Mountain landscape and reference chains","The reference mountain chain of this VC is Betic System. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is Carcabuey. Carcabuey is located in the Sierra Subbética with practically all of its extension forming part of the Natural Park. Its economy depends mainly on the olive growing with a high seasonality in employment and suffers from a process of depopulation, that continues in this trend, and the aging of its population, with almost a quarter of it over 65 years old and an exodus of the younger population that is not engaged in agriculture. On the other hand, it is a highly cohesive society, with strong intergenerational links, maintaining local culture and idiosyncrasy and showing a very participatory character."," mountain, landscape, carcabuey, park"," http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q8502, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q107425, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q842679, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q22698",-4.2734188,37.4437151,-3.5,40.2

"Interest on this VC","In a context of ageing population, care of the elderly represents an important economic activity with local peculiarities. In this case a perception of high quality (self-assessed), specific relevance due to ageing and depopulation in mountain centres in the area, interaction with the environment and territorial identity: survival of intergenerational social cohesion. Private care company that hires local women and enables them to professionalise their activity. Professionalisation through certificates of professionalism based on experience in the informal sector in a traditionally female sector and closely linked to the non-monetised and informal economy. Maintaining female population under 65 and attraction of immigrant female population (some in the formal sector, more in the informal sector).The value chain presents a scale that allows a multilevel governance system based on the proximity and interaction of all the actors involved, although a greater structuring would be necessary to coordinate the response,.","perception, self, relevance, mountain, survival, informal economy, value chain, system, structuring","http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q160402, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3236990, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1074648, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q8502, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104482419, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q944235, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q646107, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q58778, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q381442",-4.303949218091996,37.44841814220351,-3.5,40.2

Challenges,"Ageing population (23% of total population over 65, 12% over 80 ), negative replacement rate , depopulation and exodus of young population (11.4% total descent in 10 years), public resources do not cover all needs, informal economy, professionalisation process under development but not consolidated, precarisation of female work, disappearance of local and social cultures of small Sierra communities. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.","informal economy",http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q944235,-4.303949218091996,37.44841814220351,-3.5,40.2
Innovation,"The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. Informal and traditional care, from the whole society for the whole society, survive. Then a series of public services have been developed to attend to the needs of the elderly population, which through public-private partnerships have become more professionalised. Its mixed governance, combining traditional care and the new services can be considered an innovation. The innovation is related to New governance systems. The land use systems involved are urban space and infrastructures. The local assets include Social and cultural.","innovation, society, governance","http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q174165, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q8425, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1553864",-4.303949218091996,37.44841814220351,-3.5,40.2
