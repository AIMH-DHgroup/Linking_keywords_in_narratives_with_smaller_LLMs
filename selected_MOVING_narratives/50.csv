"Interest on this VC","EU Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) label and regional product label. 'Valašský' region refers to Beskydy mountains settled by Italians (Vallachians - valašský). The case is produced on the foothills of Beskydy mountains traditionally about 200 years (mostly using its the most typical /most produced in te area/ fruit for topping - pears). The product is well known througout Czechia because of its territorial identity. It is innovative VC in term of its marketing sing regional name and references to mountain ('tradittional cake from Vallachian region in Beskydy).","protected geographical indication, italians, foothills, fruit","http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3104453, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q50001, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1354045, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1364",18.011299988836573,49.34923775664669,16.0,50.0
"Key local assets","It is the whole locality symoblically specified - Vallachian region. The cake is known for 200 years but its popularity is because of the link to this region (the region sells doue to the symbol of the territory related to mountains) - region is the symbolic asset.

Challenges,"The cake utilises the regional name ('Vallachian'), it means the VC rotates about the name of the territory (not around the process of production or raw materials used) linked with the region of Beskydy mountains. The Beskydy mouniains are linked with the name Vallachian (valašský, lašský in Czech). Because of the popularity of this cake (e.g. sold on farm marekts throughout Czechia or in supermarkets) it faces problems with fake products of similar type (using name 'frgále' but not being form the locality). Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.","cake, territory, farm","http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q13276, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q183366, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q131596",18.011299988836573,49.34923775664669,16.0,50.0
Innovation,"The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. The cake is not innovative. It was innovative when it originated 200 years ago because the name 'frgále' was used by local people for spoiled scone type cake (true name was oven-done cake for those well done, 'frgale' reffered by local Vallachian people to neme spoiled cake. The innovation is related to New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are symbolic specificity of the territory (Vallachian region) - this region is considered to be traditional mounain region and people using specific dialect (Vallachian). Two products symbolise the region: 'frgále' cake and pblum brandy (spirit). The local assets include Social and cultural.","innovation, cake, people, scone, brandy","http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q174165, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q13276, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2472587, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q869660, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q146470",18.011299988836573,49.34923775664669,16.0,50.0
