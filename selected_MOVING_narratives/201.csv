"Oriental tobacco","The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is NMK. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 17 NMK. The process goes from tobacco seeds, planting seedlings, harvesting, selling the row material, processing, and selling the final tobacco product to the end users. During the growing process of tobacco, private families are engaged mainly in their agricultural land to produce the raw tobacco. Jaka Prilep is one of the well known companies which deals with the processing of the tobacco.","prilep, north macedonia","http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q157032, https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q221",21.554166666,41.346388888,21.716669444444445,41.65

"Interest on this VC","Republic of Macedonia is distinguished by tobacco production which consists only of oriental types. In Macedonia there were also big oscillations in tobacco production, depending on the state policy. In fact, this production was going to collapse, but with the subsiding policy of the state it has been reestablished, with good opportunities even to increase. This is especially important because there is no alternative crop that would absorb so much labor force and would have such an economic impact as tobacco. Annually about 30,000 families or approximately 100,000 people are involved in tobacco production. Tobacco is important for the Macedonian agriculture, because it uses relatively poorer soils, for which no one-year culture could contribute so much.","republic, tobacco, policy, people, agriculture, year","http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q7270, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1566, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1156854, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2472587, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q11451, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q577",22.83827960820973,41.69137880516686,21.716669444444445,41.65
Challenges,"Production of oriental tobacco was reduced for over four times. The reason for this decline is due to the shift from tobacco toward growing other agricultural products with more value added. The other challenge is also the less people smoking tobacco, and this is a global trend. The labor intensive need for growing and producing tobacco is also a challenge in the region. The reference region has not solid soil potential for producing tobacco. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional.","reason, tobacco, people, soil, potential","http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q178354, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1566, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2472587, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q36133, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1202245",22.83827960820973,41.69137880516686,21.716669444444445,41.65
