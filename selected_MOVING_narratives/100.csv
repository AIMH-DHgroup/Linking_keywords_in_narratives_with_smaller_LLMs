"Aloe Vera is the oldest known and the most applied medical plant worldwide. More recently Aloe Vera is cultivated and processed into a variety of byproducts in the region of Viannos, Dikti Mountain","The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is GREECE. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 09 GR. The adaptability and ease in farming led to the cultivation of Aloe vera as an alternative plant during economic crisis of 2008-2016. The plant is being processed to produce juice, gel, cosmetics, and nutraceuticals involving research, new processing and production methods and marketing strategies. The juice has been successfully integrated in the local diet and the cosmetics are also being marketed in the tourist sector. The main problem for producers is the distribution of the leaves and the fact that only a small number of leaf-processing units exist. Another issue is the seasonality in production that does not cover the fixed seasonal demand of the industry. The high cost of quality certification is also a detriment. The cooperation of Minoan Land has participated in many festivals, such as that of Cretan Diet Festival, while the Pancretan Network of Organic Farmers of Aloe Vera has cooperated with Minoan Land.","greece, plant, juice, gel, cosmetics, research, marketing, leaf, seasonality, demand","http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q41, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q756, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q8492, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q185744, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q131207, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q42240, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q39809, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q33971, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2111082, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q4402708",23.0,38.5,23.0,38.5
"Mountain landscape and reference chains","The reference mountain chain of this VC is Dikti Mountains. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is VIANNOS. Dikti mountain range has a maximum altitude of 2,148. Large parts of the mountain area are forested with pines (Pinus brutia), Kermes oaks (Quercus coccifera), cypresses (Cupressus sempervirens), Holm Oaks (Quercus ilex) and Cretan Maples (Acer sempervirens).The topology of the mountain range is rich with plateaus, valleys and secondary peaks. The fertile valleys and plateaus of Dikti/Dicte are of significant importance in the local economy. The warm and sunny climate of this mountainous region is ideal for the growth of aloe vera."," mountain, dikti, topology"," http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q8502, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1225372, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q42989",25.5,35.116667,23.0,38.5

"Interest on this VC","Aloe vera grows in poor agro ecosystems and therefore favors rural development in marginalized areas, such as the Dikti mountain landscape. In the past 10 years a specific variety is being cultivated and exported. Aloe vera is drought tolerant and ideal for growing in dry conditions such as those in the Dikti mountain landscape and elsewhere in the semi-mountainous regions of Crete. It is grown in the Dikti area and processed in newly established processing and marketing companies in the same region. There is a high interest in the nutraceutical and pharmaceutical products leading to innovation in processing and production opening wider export pathways. Aloe vera has had an essential role as a medicinal plant over millennia in the region. Its recent cultivation has continued this tradition in the Dikti mountian area, Crete, Greece, and other European countries. Aloe Vera's adaptation to the climatic and bioclimatic conditons of Viannos has been excellent. Non-demanding cultivation and use of organic fertilization has been applied. There has been a keen interest in growing aloe plants at both amateur and professional level. Strong interest of consumers in North America and Europe to use natural byproducts for health care. Recent development of processing facilities and market pathways. The cooperative of Minoan Land cooperates mostly with producers from Viannos, but in general it is a PanCretan Network. Hence, it is a value chain that has a dramatic impact both on a local and on a broader level.","dikti, crete, greece, north america, europe, mountain, landscape, aloe, interest, nutraceutical, veras, value chain","http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1225372, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q34374, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q41, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q49, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q46, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q8502, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q107425, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q127134, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q170924, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q533025, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q7920902, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q646107",25.5,35.116667,23.0,38.5
"Key local assets","The agricultural sector is the only vital sector in the Dikti Mountain landscape. Olives are the primary crop. The cultivation of Aloe Vera has highly influenced production and distribution and brought on technological developments in manufacturing methods. Aloe Vera is a supplementary income for farmers. Moreover, processing facilities focused on the food/cosmetic industries developed quickly in the past 5 years offering employment opportunities and sustaining the population in these areas. Cultivation of Aloe vera has proven to be economically viable and e-commerce and export pathways that are being further established.

Challenges,"Challenges include risk of extinction of rare plants of the local flora which are endemic to the Dikti area and Viannos. Another challenge is that only a few leaf-processing units exist in the area which can contribute to a problematic supply chain. Quality checks are costly and hence may not be sufficient in number. Moreover, fluctuating quality of production has been reported leading to risk of reduced harvests. Adulteration of the final products is another conrern and risk. In Viannos, Aloe Vera is cultivated in great quantities and that helps the young people to stay in the rural areas of the region. Competition of land use and the implementation of ambivalent investment programms are also pressing concerns in the region. Aloe vera is a very profitable investment, and that is significant for crisis-ravaged farmerns in the region. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.","risk, extinction, flora, dikti, leaf, people, aloe","http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104493, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q123509, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q131449, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1225372, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q33971, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2472587, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q127134",25.5,35.116667,23.0,38.5
Innovation,"The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. Innovation concerns: (1) A network of partners farmers and byproduct producers of Aloe Vera plants has been established in the Dikti region. The cooperative is called the Minoan Land (2) Cultivation is exclusively based on the principles of organic and contract farming and the goal is to produce high-quality leaves, free from residues of dangerous pesticides. (3) raw material processed for high biological production value nutritional supplements and herbal cosmetics based on modern green economy. The Aloe Vera leaves are processed to create juices, foods,gels, cosmetics, production of natural fertilizers as a byproduct compliments the farming industries. (4) Research activities using aromatic/medicinal plants in food industry, pharmaceutical, and nutraceuticals industries is new to the regioin. Medical instituions and societies have approved of the juice for specific medical conditions and diets. The innovation is related to New products, New processes and New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are Cropland and Natural land. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.","research, innovation, dikti, contract farming, aloe, food","http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q42240, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q174165, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1225372, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q5165669, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q127134, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2095",25.5,35.116667,23.0,38.5
"Concluding remarks","Aloe Vera may be of interest in other MRLs it grows in other areas of Crete. Produstion exists in Andalusia, Spain.
