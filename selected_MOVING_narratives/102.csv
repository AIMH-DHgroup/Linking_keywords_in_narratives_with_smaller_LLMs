"Apicature activities in mountainous areas of Kissamos, Chania","The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is GREECE. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 11 GR. Local beekeepers produce pefkothymaromelo with the traditional way of apicature. Their familes are involved. The product is processed by local units. The Region of Crete has additionally created a special regional labelling system for the quality systems of EU Geographical Indications (GIs ). In this way, the production chain contributes substantially to the socio-ecological system of the region. In the area, the honey factories are certified by this regional label. Pefkothymaromelo is an excellent product of Crete, widely used in local gastronomy and a fovourite buy for the visitors of the area.","crete, greece, system, socio-ecological system","http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q34374, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q41, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q58778, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q7552762",24.893333333,35.309722222,23.0,38.5
"Mountain landscape and reference chains","The reference mountain chain of this VC is White Mountains. The reference mountain landscape of this VC is KISSAMOS. Î¤he White Mountains (2.453 m), the largest massif on the island, host a great variety of flora and fauna species, exclusively endemic (stenoendemic), not to be found anywhere else not even in other parts of Crete. The areas on the southern side of the mountain range are covered with cypress, oak and pine trees, whereas humid areas favour the development of chestnuts, planes and other aquatic plants.","crete, mountain, kissamos","http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q34374, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q8502, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1021629",24.893333333,35.309722222,23.0,38.5

"Interest on this VC","Apicature in Kissamos mountains is a traditional activity. Pefkothimaromelo is a PDO, a natural blend of pine and thyme honey, produced in Crete, through a specific management of the hives.The blending creates a special category of honey, which combines the mild taste of pine honey with the intense aromatic profile of thyme and is characterized by the presence of Cretan plants. Individual beekeepers in the mountains of Kissamos produce pefkothymatomelo and small companies of the area buy, standardize and resell honey that complies with the constraints of PDO. Pefkothymaromelo is a high quality product of high reputation and value. Pefkothymaromelo along with new types of honey products give a boost in the consumption of honey in general, making the products more attractive to the new target groups of consumers. New marketing and promotion strategies re now employed in order for this new innovative products to be more known to the tourist sector.","kissamos, crete, thyme, honey, management, taste","http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1021629, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q34374, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3215980, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q10987, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2920921, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q124794",23.65,35.48333333,23.0,38.5
"Key local assets","The beekeeping in the mountainous areas of Topolia/Kissamos, covered with forests, is a traditional activity that is closely linked to the Cretan way of life. The production of honey in the mountainous is usual a complementary activity of local people while few beekeeprs have been focused on the more intensive form of production. Obviously, locals have a strong historical, cultural and social tie with beekeeping (Minoan Civilization 1600 BC). This tradition is a source of inspiration and creation in many other fields such as literature. poetry, jewellery production etc.). Due to the special climate of Crete (high number of sunshine days annually, not extremely low temperatures, etc.) these activities take place for a long time in the mountainous areas, significantly helping the local communities. During the autumn the bee colonies are transferred to specific forest areas where bees are able to collect the pine tree juices in order to produce pine honey. These seasonal activities can reduce the outflow of the local population to urban centres.

Challenges,"Due to climate change, Crete has been affected by severe weather conditions in the last 20 years. Temperature changes and especially heat waves affect the behavior of bees and drastically reduce honey production. At the same time, the use of pesticides has increased in areas where there exist intensive agricultural holdings. Another challenge for Pefkothymaromelo is the adulteration with inferior types of honey, some of them imported in extremely low prices. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.","crete, heat, behavior, honey","http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q34374, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q44432, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q9332, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q10987",24.893333333,35.309722222,23.0,38.5
Innovation,"The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. Although a product of traditional apicature, pefkothymaromelo has introduced a new type of honey, branded and protected by the PDO characterization. In the Kissamos area there are a few small processing units, which, apart from pure pefkothymaromelo, make a variety of products based on honey. The innovation is related to New products, New marketing strategies and New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Forestry and Natural land. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.","innovation, honey, characterization, kissamos, marketing, governance","http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q174165, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q10987, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2667413, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1021629, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q39809, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1553864",23.65,35.48333333,23.0,38.5
"Concluding remarks","In Greece, very few honeys have been registered in EU katalog (eAmbrosia). Peyfothymaromelo is the only Cretan honey in this katalog.","greece, honey","http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q41, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q10987",23.625859265993725,35.42608126939979,23.0,38.5
