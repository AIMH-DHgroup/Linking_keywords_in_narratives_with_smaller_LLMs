"Key local assets","The Amatrice area, with its woods and organic or integrated agriculture production (due to the ecological constraints of the nature park), is engaged in the high-quality production of organic honey. Honey is also a historical and cultural traditional food in this mountain area. Both of those aspects allowing the VC to be characterised by natural and cultural elements.

Challenges,"First, climate change is a significant challenge for honey production (both adverse effects on plants' biological cycles and the bees' ability to resist colder/warmer zones). Second, the honey market is quite competitive, and certification of origin or organic label can be insufficient without an appropriate marketing strategy designed by the farmer and promoter of certificate of origin (in this case, the Municipality of Amatrice). Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional.","honey, amatrice","http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q10987, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q223427",13.288372222,42.629380555,12.5,42.5
Innovation,"The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is unspecified. The innovation consists mainly in adhering to the Miele di Amatrice label, a certification of origin and craftsmanship of production promoted by the municipality of Amatrice. The intent is to allow greater competitiveness of local mountain farms by preserving and promoting a historical local food (the honey) to attract consumers interested in the local cultural tradition on wine and food productions. The innovation is related to the whole VC. The land use systems involved are Cropland and Natural land. The local assets include Natural and cultural.","innovation, amatrice, certification, municipality, mountain, food, honey, tradition, wine","http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q174165, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q223427, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q374814, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q15284, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q8502, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2095, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q10987, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q82821, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q282",13.288372222,42.629380555,12.5,42.5
