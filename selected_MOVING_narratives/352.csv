"Interest on this VC","Cielos de Ascara is a unique and responsible project that recovers the natural, cultural, and ecological heritage in the Aragonese Pyrenees. It integrates people with particular social and labor insertion difficulties. The project pursues its members' cooperation to manage natural resources and inputs for organic food production efficiently. The project combines actions in mountain and valley areas and promotes public-private collaboration. It is an endogenous innovation project that connects multiple local actors while efficiently leveraging public co-financing aimed at promoting territorially-based social development.","ascara, project, pyrenees, cooperation, organic food, mountain, valley, collaboration","http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q8206262, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q170584, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q12431, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q380962, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q380778, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q8502, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q39816, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1145523",-0.652777777,42.569166666,-3.5,40.2
"Key local assets","Aragon has an important food heritage. There is a growing demand for sustainable, proximity, healthy, higher quality, and flavorful horticultural products. However, despite the demand, it is currently constrained, and the consumer has hardly any access. Besides, the current market is looking for innovative products as a diversity source for a standardized market occupied by few varieties. Faced with this situation, the project 'Organic Production of Foodstuffs linked to the Aragonese Territory' will carry out actions that will allow the recovery of traditional products.

Challenges,"The main challenge is to guarantee sustainability in its triple economic, social, and ecological aspects and maintain a solid and flexible collaboration between the institutional and private actors that support the project and articulate an effective interconnection between the different activities promoted by the project. Extending this model and collaborating with other similar initiatives could reinforce its strategy and make it gain visibility. The support of public funding for rural development policies and the connection with urban consumption environments are opportunities to be successfully developed. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current. This VC is classified as Innovative.","sustainability, collaboration, project, interconnection, funding","http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q219416, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1145523, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q170584, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1665949, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q6055890",-0.5516152141837889,42.550615423417995,-3.5,40.2
Innovation,"The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous. It is an innovative project in its general strategy of revitalization of rural and mountain areas, with particular attention to areas of natural and cultural interest, which aims to recover traditional varieties, promote organic production and consumption, connect rural and urban areas, generate employment, foster social integration and stimulate forms of public-private cooperation. The innovation is related to New products, New processes, New marketing strategies and New governance systems. The land use systems involved are Cropland.

"Concluding remarks","Besides, the actions will be developed in areas of Sites of Community Importance (SCI) and Special Protection Area for Birds (SPA) of the protected landscape of San Juan de la Peña and Monte Oroel and the Natural Park of the Western Valleys. Part of the Torres de Berrellén melon trials will also be carried out at the research centre Centro de Investigación y Tecnología Agroalimentaria de Aragón (CITA) facilities located in Montañana. The transformation part will be carried out in the Processing Plant of organic vegetables and fruits of the Special Employment Center Gardeniers of ATADES, in the organic canning workshop that manages in Mercazaragoza. Similar initiatives are found in many rural areas, also sometimes in mountain areas, in Europe. However, the proposal's solidity stands out here, articulated on innovative bases, agroecology, social insertion, and digital bet.","europe, special protection area, spa, landscape, juan, park, research, plant, employment, canning, workshop, mountain, agroecology","http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q46, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2463705, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1341387, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q107425, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q475210, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q22698, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q42240, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q756, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q656365, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q843389, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q656720, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q8502, http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q396338",-0.5516152141837889,42.550615423417995,-3.5,40.2
